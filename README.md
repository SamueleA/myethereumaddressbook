My Ethereum Address Book is an alternative to MyEtherWallet that lets you save your friends addresses in an address book.

Add ethereum addresses with a tag. You can then send ether to their ethereum address via Metamask!

Entries are saved in the browser's local storage. You can also export your data in a file via 'Save Profile'.

Add me as a friend :) <br/>
